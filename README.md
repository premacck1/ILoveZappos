### Challenge Description
To challenger: <br>
This challenge is to build an app that takes input from the user as a search query and returns the first item and display it as a product page. You do not need to make it look like our app, show us how you would build this from scratch using your own design. The app should have a floating action button on the screen that does some sort of animation to indicate that something has been added to a cart. You will use databinding for the product page you create.

### Requirement
- Databinding for the product page. See reference: [Data-binding for Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/index.html)
- Animation when floating action button clicked. See reference: [Animation for Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/training/animation/index.html)

### Bonus points for:
- Following Material Design guidelines. See reference: [Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/)
- Well handled configuration changes. See reference: [Handling configuration changes](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/runtime-changes.html)
- Using retrofit to handle your REST requests. See reference: [Retrofit APIs](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
